# Arduino Matlab Instantaneous Radar Project
This project is modified in a way that it enables HCSR-04 ultrasonic sensor to rotate 180 degree around its axis to **instantenously** create a polar plot, use color coding for showing the rotation around positive/negative axis, and create a plot of theta(rad) vs. distance(cm) at the end of sweeping the entire are twice and taking the average of both movements to increase the accuracy of the results.
## Setup
Please do not forget to change `COM6` in line 7 to your own COM port by checking it on Arduino IDE.
